<p>So long story less long, I only just got internet running in my apartment a few weeks ago (I moved in early August), and things have been oh so busy.</p>

<p>So so busy in fact, that I sadly was unable to work on creating this blog until recent times. To make up for that fact and to avoid a massive info dump I am splitting up my first blog post into two blog posts (can you believe it)! This part will go over a mostly accurate (hopefully) recollection of my past first few weeks in Japan!!</p>

<p>To kick things off, I actually want to talk about my last few weeks in America. Its crazy to me that it doesn’t feel like much time has passed since I was doing my last summer league Ultimate Frisbee game, or going to Wildwood, NJ to play frisbee on the beach with good friends, or hanging out with my bud in Philly by going to the arcade or watching that Arsenal vs. Liverpool game, or even my short stint staying at my bestie’s place in DC for the annoyingly long orientation and flight. Though, it also feels like everything has changed, and I have no idea how I got here. Needless to say… Life’s a Beach.</p>

<p>Anyway, so my first few days in Japan were spent in Shinjuku, Tokyo as all the newbies in the program like myself had to go through another set of orientation. The hotel we were staying was super fancy, dare I say bougie, and I remember just immediately going to bed once I got to my room (our flight ended up being 20 hours because of delays :( ) I kinda wish I had the energy to go explore the city or something that night but I did later, and it was a long day, so it’s fine. I actually wasn’t too too jet-lagged, or at least didn’t feel that bad all week with the help of the incredibly strong coffee the hotel had. To avoid boring you to death, I will spare all the various info that was gone over during orientation like what a guy’s gotta do to stay safe during a typhoon or the different types of health insurances in Japan. My favorite part of orientation, however, was being able to talk to all the other people among the 700 or so of us that were there and also seeing what my job would actually look like.</p>

<p>The first night of orientation I, with immense conviction and will, decided to venture out into the streets. I figured that I could get over my jet-lag quicker if I stayed up longer, and it would be nice to go on a walk after I’ve been literally sitted in a chair practically for hours. And, hey, when’s the next time I’ll ever be in this city: might as well make the most of it. So, before I left, I went to the money transfer machine and converted like 100 bucks into yen because I only had like 20 yen total given to me by friends ;). I actually then end up bumping into a friend I met earlier that day during the point where they made all of us split into different rooms based on where we going. This guy is also placed in Aomori-ken so I had gotten to know him. He and someone else from the UK were going out too, and I was like “where y’all going?” and then they were like “oh we are going to do some shopping” and then I said “oh nice, i was gonna just go onna walk. can i come?” and then they said “yeah!” To yap less, I basically spent that night with a bunch of British adults since after we went to Uniqlo to buy shirts, we ran into their other friends, and in typical fashion, they were like “we’re gonna go get a drink” That was pretty fun: they were friendly folks and I actually had to use my Japanese at the restaurant we went to because no one at our table wanted to eat the otoshi (we lowkey caused trouble and i wished i wasn’t so jet-lagged so i could speak properly, ugh) Also, Shinjuku is really cool.</p>
